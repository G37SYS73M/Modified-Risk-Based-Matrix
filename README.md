# Modified Risk-Based Severity Matrix for Red Team Engagements

To appropriately assess the severity of findings discovered during the Red Team engagement, we utilized a **Modified Risk-Based Matrix** tailored specifically for offensive security operations. Unlike traditional vulnerability scoring systems (e.g., CVSS), this model incorporates not just the technical impact of a vulnerability or action, but also its **business relevance**, **real-world exploitability**, and **detectability** by defensive mechanisms.

This scoring system provides a more accurate representation of the **operational risk** posed by Red Team activities, enabling stakeholders to prioritize remediation efforts based on **real-world attack scenarios**.

## ðŸ“Š Scoring Dimensions

The Modified Risk-Based Matrix evaluates severity using three primary factors:

### 1. Impact

This metric represents the potential **business and technical consequence** of the attack or exploit.

| Impact Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Full compromise of crown jewels (e.g., domain controllers, production databases, sensitive customer data), persistent backdoor access, or exfiltration of confidential information. |
| **High**     | Compromise of critical infrastructure, lateral movement into restricted network segments, or access to regulated data (e.g., PII, PHI, PCI). |
| **Medium**   | User privilege escalation, access to sensitive but non-critical internal systems or data. |
| **Low**      | Initial access with limited privileges, successful phishing without internal movement, or discovery of misconfigurations with low business impact. |

### 2. Detectability

This dimension captures how effectively the activity was observed or responded to by the organizationâ€™s **defensive capabilities** (e.g., SOC, EDR, SIEM).

| Detection Level | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Undetected**   | No alerts triggered, no telemetry collected, no response initiated. |
| **Partially Detected** | Some activity was logged or observed but not appropriately escalated or contained. |
| **Detected**     | Activity was identified and properly acted upon by defensive teams. |

### 3. Ease of Exploitation

This reflects the **level of effort, tooling, and skill** required to achieve the action or compromise.

| Ease Level | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Easy**   | Use of commodity tools or known exploits requiring minimal effort. |
| **Moderate**| Attack required chaining of multiple weaknesses or minimal customization. |
| **Hard**   | Required advanced techniques, custom tooling, or significant planning. |

### Scoring Methodology

Each finding is assigned a **composite severity score** by evaluating the **combined effect of impact, detectability, and ease of exploitation**. This produces a score on a **scale from 0.0 to 10.0**, enabling prioritization similar to other frameworks, but grounded in the reality of adversarial simulation.

#### Step-by-Step Scoring Logic

1. **Assign Base Risk Score** from the qualitative matrix:

| Detectability \\ Impact | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|------------------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| **Undetected**         | 9.0      | 8.5  | 7.0    | 6.0 |
| **Partially Detected** | 8.5      | 7.5  | 6.0    | 4.0 |
| **Detected**           | 7.5      | 6.0  | 3.5    | 2.5 |

2. **Apply Ease of Exploitation Modifier**:

| Ease Level   | Modifier |
|--------------|----------|
| **Easy**     | -0.5     |
| **Moderate** | Â±0.0     |
| **Hard**     | +0.5     |

Final Score = Base Score + Modifier

#### Example Scenarios

| Scenario                          | Impact   | Detection          | Ease     | Final Score |
|----------------------------------|----------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| Domain Admin via Kerberoasting   | Critical | Undetected         | Moderate | 9.5         |
| Phishing to Workstation Access   | Medium   | Detected           | Easy     | 5.0         |
| PrivEsc on DMZ Host              | High     | Partially Detected | Moderate | 7.0         |
| Password Spray on Login Portal   | Low      | Detected           | Easy     | 2.5         |

This methodology enables balanced and realistic risk classification, grounded in attacker TTPs and operational impact.

## ðŸ§  Purpose and Benefits

This severity model provides:

- **Real-world risk prioritization** based on operational outcomes, not just static vulnerabilities.
- Enhanced value for **Blue Teams** by showing where gaps in detection exist.
- Flexibility to align with **business priorities**, including crown jewel protection, regulatory exposure, and response effectiveness.
